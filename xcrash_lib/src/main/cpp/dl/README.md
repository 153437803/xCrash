# xCrash DL

## The Problem

All the time, Android's DL series functions have some compatibility and ability issues:

### dl\_iterate\_phdr()

1. Only available in Android >= 5.0 (on arm32 architecture).
2. It does not hold the linker's global lock in Android 5.x, this may cause a crash during iterating.
3. In some Android 4.x and 5.x devices, it returns basename instead of full pathname.
4. linker/linker64 is only included since Android 8.1.

### dlopen() & dlsym()

1. Since Android 7.0, dlopen() and dlsym() cannot operate system libraries. (Although in most cases, we donâ€™t really need to load the dynamic library from the disk, but just need to get the address of a function to call it.)
2. dlsym() can only obtain symbols in .dynsym, but we sometimes need to obtain internal symbols in .symtab and ".symtab in .gnu_debugdata".
3. dlsym() does not distinguish between functions and objects when searching for symbols. In ELF files with a lot of symbols, this will reduce search efficiency, especially for .symtab.

## The Solution

This module (xCrash DL) tries to make up the above problem. Enjoy the code ~

In addition, the source code of this module does not depend on any other source code of xCrash, so you can easily use them in your own projects.

## The History

xCrash 2.x contains a very rudimentary module (xc_dl) for searching system library symbols, which has many problems in performance and compatibility. xCrash uses it to search a few symbols from libart, libc and libc++.

Later, some other projects began to use the xc_dl module alone, including in some performance-sensitive usage scenarios. At this time, we began to realize that we need to rewrite this module, and we need a better implementation.
